"""
build_nexus_dex_hubs.py -- v2.0 (Verixia / v18.4)

Builds hub landing pages from the keyword cluster mapping.

What changed from v1.x -> v2.0:
  - 11 hubs total (down from 20): 5 product surfaces + 5 commercial hubs +
    1 catch-all fallback.
  - Dropped all perps content (no Hyperliquid, no BTC/ETH/SOL perp hubs, no
    altcoin perps, no prediction markets, no leverage/margin language).
  - Consolidated 6 legacy xStocks hubs into a single brand-tokens hub.
  - Brand tokens are treated as Solana SPL tokens that track popular brands.
    No backing claims, no custody claims, no "1:1 backed" language, no
    "regulated Swiss custody" language, no Backed Finance attribution.
  - Memes hub uses Wonderland voice (degen-friendly but tasteful).
  - Bridges hub covers cross-chain inbound to Solana from 9+ chains.
  - BRAND_CASE, CHANNEL_HINTS, INTENT_HINTS scrubbed of Hyperliquid, MetaMask,
    perp, prediction terms.
  - HTML/CSS template preserved (Wonderland palette: mint/pink/violet).

        ("Are there limits on how much I can ape?", "No. There are no daily caps and no maximum trade size. Minimum trade amounts exist only because Solana transactions have a small gas cost, not because of any policy."),
        ("Can I trade new memecoins right after launch?", "Yes. As soon as a token has liquidity on a supported Solana DEX, Verixia picks it up automatically. You can swap into fresh launches the same minute they go live."),
        ("Does Verixia hold the memecoin in custody?", "No. Tokens land directly in your Solana wallet after the swap. Verixia never holds funds. Your wallet, your keys, your tokens."),
    ],
    "live-signals": [
        ("Where does the signals data come from?", "Directly from on-chain Solana activity. Fresh launches, top gainers, and volume leaders are pulled from live indexed pool and token data, not from a third-party aggregator."),
        ("Can I trade a signal directly from the feed?", "Yes. Tap any signal to open the swap interface pre-filled with the token. Connect your wallet, sign the swap, and the trade settles in seconds."),
    ],
    "brand-tokens": [
        ("What are brand tokens?", "Brand tokens are Solana SPL tokens that track popular brands like Apple, Tesla, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, MicroStrategy, and others. They trade as standard SPL tokens on Solana DEXes."),
        ("Do I need a broker account or KYC?", "No. Brand tokens are SPL tokens. Connect a Solana wallet, fund it with USDC or SOL, and swap. There is no broker signup, no ID upload, and no centralized account at the protocol level."),
        ("How do I trade a brand token?", "Search for the ticker (AAPLx, TSLAx, NVDAx, etc.) inside Verixia and swap from USDC or SOL. The trade routes across Jupiter, Raydium, and Orca for best price and settles to your wallet in seconds."),
        ("Can I hold brand tokens in my Solana wallet?", "Yes. Once you buy, the brand token lives in your wallet alongside SOL, USDC, and any other SPL token. You can hold, swap, or transfer it like any other Solana token."),

    "solana-bridges": [
        ("Which chains can I bridge from to Solana?", "Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, BNB Chain, Sui, Aptos, and 60+ others. Verixia routes through Wormhole, deBridge, and Allbridge to find the fastest path for each pair."),
        ("How long does a bridge take?", "Most bridges complete in a few minutes. Time varies by source chain finality. Once funds land on Solana, they are immediately tradable inside Verixia."),

        ("How is Verixia different from Jupiter directly?", "Verixia aggregates Jupiter, Raydium, Orca, Meteora, and other DEXes to find the best price across all of them in one transaction. You also get integrated brand tokens, Wonderland memes, bridging, and signals."),

    "wallet-trading": [
        ("Does Verixia ever hold my funds?", "No. Funds stay in your wallet between trades. Each trade is signed from your wallet and settles on-chain. Verixia is just an interface to Solana DEX liquidity."),

    ],
    "whale-tracking": [
        ("What counts as smart money?", "Wallets with consistent profitable trades, early entries on tokens that pumped, deployer clusters with track records, and KOL wallets. Verixia surfaces these wallets and their current positions in real time."),

    ],
    "token-launch": [
        ("Do I need to write code to launch a token?", "No. The launchpad is no-code. You name the token, set basic parameters like supply and ticker, and deploy from your wallet."),

    "how-to-guides": [
        ("Where should I start if I'm new to Solana wallets?", "Start with the wallet setup guide. It walks through creating a Phantom or Backpack wallet, funding it with SOL, and connecting to Verixia for your first swap."),
        ("Do the guides cover mobile?", "Yes. Every guide is mobile-first because the entire Verixia interface is designed for mobile execution. The flows shown in the guides work the same on iOS and Android."),
    ],
    "crypto-markets": [
        ("What can I do on Verixia?", "Swap any Solana token, trade brand tokens like AAPLx and TSLAx, ape Wonderland memes, bridge in from 60+ chains, track whales, launch your own token, and follow live signals — all from your wallet."),

    "brand-tokens": "Brand tokens are standard Solana SPL tokens. When you swap into one, the trade routes across Jupiter, Raydium, and Orca to find the best price. The token settles directly to your wallet, where it lives alongside your SOL, USDC, and any other SPL token. You can hold it, swap it, or transfer it like any other Solana asset.",

Verixia routes through Wormhole, deBridge, or Allbridge depending on the source chain and token. You sign on the source chain, the bridge protocol mints or releases the equivalent on Solana, and the tokens land in your Solana wallet ready to trade.",
